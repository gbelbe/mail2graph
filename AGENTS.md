## Tidy First & craftsmanship (mandatory before every feature/fix commit)

Before writing a feature or fix, check the file(s)/function(s)/class(es) it
touches against the catalog in `CRAFTSMANSHIP.md` (Kent Beck's *Tidy First?*,
Fowler's *Refactoring* smells, *Clean Code*, and Feathers' legacy-code
method). If a tidying applies, do it alone, verify the suite is unchanged,
and commit it separately, naming the source:

```
tidy(<type>): <what and where>

Tidy-Type: <type>
Tidy-Source: <author, book>
```

Only then commit the feature/fix. If nothing applies, don't invent one —
commit with a `Tidy-Exempt: <reason>` trailer instead.

The catalog is also a checklist for **new** code, not just a pre-touch
ritual: Beck's four rules of simple design (pass the tests, reveal intention,
no duplication, fewest elements) and Clean Code's function-size/SOLID
principles are the acceptance bar for anything written from scratch — there's
nothing to "tidy" in code that doesn't exist yet, but there's everything to
get right the first time.

Touching code with no tests? It's legacy by Feathers' definition regardless
of age — write a `test(characterize):` commit pinning its current behavior
first, *then* tidy under that safety net. See `CRAFTSMANSHIP.md`'s "Working
with legacy code."

The `tidy-ratchet` check (pre-push hook / CI, `scripts/check_tidy_ratchet.sh`)
enforces the discipline — it fails a push/PR with no `tidy(...)` commit, no
`test(characterize):` commit, and no `Tidy-Exempt:` trailer in range. It's a
text check on commit messages only, so it costs milliseconds; it cannot judge
whether the right tidying was picked.

For the subset of the catalog craftCov can detect mechanically (`scripts/
craftcov.py --list-detectors`, if you've installed the `craftcov` extra —
see README), skip the judgment call: `scripts/craftcov.py --file <path>`
before touching a file, fix one instance of every heuristic it finds
present, bundle it all into one `tidy(multi):` commit (see
`CRAFTSMANSHIP.md`'s "Refactor First" for the exact convention). CI's
`refactor-first` job (`scripts/check_refactor_first.py`,
`templates/ci-job.yml`) enforces the *outcome* — a touched file's total
across those heuristics must go down, or stay at 0 — and no finding may sit
on a line you added or rewrote. `Tidy-Exempt:` waives the first, never the
second: new code is never exempt.

A third, independent gate covers cyclomatic/cognitive complexity,
invariant return, and duplicated string literal (if you've installed the
`complexity` extra — see README): `scripts/check_complexity_ratchet.py`
(CI's `complexity` job) grandfathers a function/literal the diff never
reaches, but one it *does* reach that's already over threshold must come
out lower than it went in — unchanged doesn't pass, only a genuine
decrease does (needn't reach the threshold in one PR). `Tidy-Exempt:` waives
that debt rule, but a new function over the threshold, a new invariant return
or a new duplicated literal fails regardless. See
`CRAFTSMANSHIP.md`'s "The complexity ratchet".

**Write within these limits from the start, don't wait for a gate to catch
it**: CRAFTSMANSHIP.md's "The mechanical floor" table has the *exact*
numbers `refactor-first`/`complexity` check (≤5 params, ≤50 statements,
≤12 branches, ≤7 instance attributes, ≤15 cyclomatic/cognitive complexity,
no repeated 5+ char literal more than twice per file, etc.) — know them
while writing new code, not only when craftCov or the complexity ratchet
flags something after the fact. Before calling a change done, run both
locally against what you touched: `scripts/craftcov.py --file <path>` and
`scripts/check_complexity_ratchet.py --path <dir> --base origin/main`.

If this repo has the `patch-coverage` job (see README — it needs your own
`pytest --cov` setup, not every repo has it wired in): new code must be
covered by a test *in the same change*, not added after a gate flags a
gap. That job has no `Tidy-Exempt:` bypass.

If this repo also has the `mutation-ratchet` job (default alongside
`patch-coverage`; mutation testing requires `[tool.mutmut]` source paths — see
README): coverage proving a line ran isn't the same as a test proving it
matters. Write toward killing mutants — exact-value assertions, both sides
of every boundary, every branch tested on its own — see
`templates/tdd-bdd-yagni.snippet.md`'s "Writing tests mutants can't
survive" if this repo uses that companion section. Same no-`Tidy-Exempt:`
rule; a genuinely equivalent mutant gets mutmut's own `# pragma: no
mutate` instead.

**The numbers live in `craft-gate.toml`** (or `[tool.craft-gate]` in `pyproject.toml`): the
complexity limits, Refactor First's per-file rule, the design-review limits, the thresholds of the
test gates, and what a `Tidy-Exempt:` trailer may waive. craft-gate's `templates/craft-gate.toml`
lists every value with its default. Read the repo's file for the real numbers before you write
code, and **never loosen a value to make a gate pass**: fix the code. If a change must edit that
file, say why in the commit message: the PR comment lists every value the change loosens, and a
person decides, because a looser value fails no check.

**The test gates are on by default.** `patch-coverage`, `mutation-ratchet` and
`behaviour-coverage` run unless the config switches one off with `enabled = false` and a written
`reason`. A gate that is on but has nothing to check (no pytest suite, no `[tool.mutmut]`, no
`.feature` files) fails; it never passes silently. Write the test with the code.

**Behaviour coverage.** Where the repo has Gherkin scenarios (default `tests/features`), every
line you add or change must be exercised by a scenario, not only by unit tests: add or extend a
scenario with the change. Test files are left out of the patch and behaviour percentages, so a
test's own lines never count toward them.

Before you push, read your own design prompts and get an independent review. If the repo has
`scripts/design_review.py`, run `python3 scripts/design_review.py --base origin/main` and either
fix each prompt or write one line on why it does not apply. If it has the `craft-review` skill,
run it: it hands the diff to the `craft-reviewer` subagent, a lead-developer reviewer with no
knowledge of how the code was written. Give it nothing but the base ref; your reasons are exactly
what it must not inherit. Both are advisory, and both cover the judgement calls no gate can make.

**Opening a pull request.** If the repo has `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, fill in its reviewer
checklist honestly (one thing per function, names, commands vs queries, responsibility, tests that
state the behaviour, YAGNI): tick what you checked, or say why it does not apply. It covers the
judgement calls no gate can make.

Before declaring a Python behavior change complete, apply the mutation-quality
checklist:

1. Identify changed production functions from the diff, not only the files.
2. Select or add focused unit tests and mark them `@pytest.mark.mutation` when
   the repository uses focused mutmut selection.
3. Assert exact outputs, side effects, calls, and errors, not just execution.
4. Cover both sides of changed boundaries and each changed error/empty branch.
5. Run focused mutmut and inspect survivors for the changed functions.
6. Strengthen a survivor with a behavior-specific test, or use `# pragma: no
   mutate` only when the mutation is genuinely equivalent.

The ratchet passes per changed function at the threshold (80% by default), or at
20% improvement over that function's recorded score in
`.mutation-baseline.json`, which never asks for more than the threshold itself.
A function with no recorded score — new, or never measured, including a legacy
function you merely edit — must reach the threshold outright on the first push: there is no grace run. Plan for that while writing
the tests (see `templates/tdd-bdd-yagni.snippet.md`, "Design the tests before
the code"), not after the gate refuses the push.
